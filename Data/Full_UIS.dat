I thought that after Hurricane Matthew a lot of people would have made better preparations in the county would have made improvements but that has not occurred. I just think that this is going to be a cycle of never-ending  hurricanes and lack of preparation in our area. I am an emergency employee so during any event people all around me need assistance. After Hurricane Florence everyone needed help including myself. I was just not able to physically, emotionally, or mentally aid others as I did in Hurricane Matthew.

Now we have to move. There has been several delays. So each day it feels like a new problem.	I'm experiencing thoughts that due to the current rain and what happened during the Hurricane that our driveway will cave in and we will be stuck again.	I have watched the weather reports.

It is bringing back memories of the Hurricane such as No way to get out, worrying about running out of food, and no way for my husband to get to work which eventually left him without a job."	Fear of a repeat Hurricane. Racing thoughts of what would happen if it occurred again. Frustration because I feel like I should have listened to my instincts and left before the Hurricane.	"I have tried refocusing on other things. I have tried reading or watching movies but even though it may temporarily distracted me from those feelings, They always come back."

I'm concerned of more rain that is forecasted for this weekend will not only cause delay in moving but it also leaves the worry of more damage it may cause to my driveway that was damaged in the Hurricane.	That the uhaul will get stuck in the driveway. That the rain will delay our move and destroy more of my driveway which brings me back to feeling trapped in the Hurricane.	I have tried to remove as much as my stuff over in vehicles. I have watched the weather channel. I have purchased all the things I need in case of more flooding.

"When will the next hurricane hit. Will it be this year? Will it be worse than Florence or Matthew? Will my house be able to survive another hurricane? It's a mobile home and the wind was so bad during florence, it felt like the whole house could collapse at any time. The wind was so strong and was getting inside through corners and seams in the walls. It destroyed the panelling in my bedroom. The water was up to our steps and thankfully, eventually, stopped rising. Will that happen this time, or will my home and all my belongings be destroyed due to flooding? Will the car get flooded next time? I dont know what is to come and I dont know how to handle what could be thrown my way. The hurricanes seem to get worse every time. Having 2 major hurricanes in 2 years has given me a constant fear of weather, especially during the summer. Last time we stuck in this mobile home with no power, no running water, and very little food. Things could have gone so much worse, and I'm thankful they didn't.

The loneliness I feel living here is just soooo frustrating. I was in the ER yesterday and I had absolutely no one to call to drive me home so they could give me pain medication. So, I did what I had to do. I left the ER without any pain relief and drove myself to the pharmacy. I'm just tired of feeling very alone in a world full of people. I'm sorry.

I just keep picking myself back off of the ground and trying all over again. with the exception of a few weeks of government emergency aid...right after the hurricane, there are so few resources here for people who are struggling to keep food on the table or to pay for their life saving medications.

"I have friends that lost everything and are still in hotels. I should be grateful that it was only our roof, back door and chicken coup. We lost so many trees that it feels as if we will never get the yard cleaned. The chickens have no where to roost because the coop and yard were totalled by Florence.

I was raised in Alaska, I have been through earthquakes, blizzards and volcanoes and I have never been as terrified as I was of that hurricane. I've been through several hurricanes here in North Carolina but none of hit us the way Florence did. Then to have Michael come after it's just a couple weeks later was just too much. There still standing water everywhere and the mosquitoes are starting to come out."	I have been stockpiling canned food and water. (even pet food) we didn't run out of anything when Florence hit but I'm afraid I won't be able to have water for my children.	I have been talking to a counselor. And again I'm stockpiling things in amounts that I probably will never need again. I panic a little bit if we get below 4 Flats of water bottles. We are on a well so if we don't have power we don't have water. I'm storing canned food and toilet paper Etc an unused closet upstairs. In the last month we've had two power outages that lasted a couple hours each because of bad weather. I cannot believe how much turmoil comes up when the lights go out and it's storming outside. I have never been this way. I was always the person on the front porch watching the Storm come in and loving the thunder and lightning!

Tress were down and it has taken almost two years to have them removed.  I experienced cancer, C.diffe, and back surgery in these two years, trying to juggle work, finances, and facing life alone.  I barely began to recover when Hurricane Florence hit.  My roof started leaking and the kitchen was destroyed. I watched as water again came near my home as the pond flooded.  Our pond had damage to the dam and has just now been restored and water is now  returning and it is filling up again. I am already anxious about flooding even though I know it will not right now.  My repairs to the roof are almost finished and things put back into place.  Insurance money barely covered costs and I am retired, alone, and living on $883 dollars a month.  My gas pack is destroyed and a gas wall heater is my source of keeping warm.  I have lived in my living room  and slept on the couch for 4 months and shut the other rooms off.   It has been a cold long winter and I have worried about everything.  When the washing machine fills with water, it reminds me of the sound of rain filling my kitchen as it started leaking in 19 different places.  Some days are better than others and at least my health is so much better.  It is warm and I can work outside now."	 	"I have prayed and am grateful for my home and health being restored.  I have been blessed with folks to work on the house and have tried to logically take things one step at a time with gratitude and appreciation , all with patience and resignation of the situation.

I can't help but think of how it flooded during the last two hurricanes which did damage to trees and my home. I am just recovering from both of them.  Some Things I cannot repair and am watching my shop roof continue to blow away and rain destroy the contents.   It is like a flash back.  I turned my heat on again this morning to knock off the chill.  I am already worried about affording gas to keep warm next year and paying property taxes.  I can't seem to shake off a feeling of dread and anxiety and the fear of losing what I have.	 	Every day I assign myself a task or goal inside or outside.  I have submitted information to renew EBT.   I will call my doctor's office Monday to see why my insurance did not cover the last office visit.  I have done my Bible study and continue to pray and thank God for His blessings.  Just accomplishing even one small thing brings order back into my life.

Even though warm weather is here, I'm already worried about affording gas to heat this winter which will be about a six month period.   My neighbor has been shooting guns for the past two hours and has me on edge.  Water is rising in the pond behind my house and there is about  a 25 wide swath of floatsom and debris hugging the shoreline behind the house.  I've never seen this in my lifetime.  It is ugly and reminds me of how it flooded during the hurricane.  I don't know how to remove it or clean it up.  It seems like the damage will never end.  "	I feel hopeless and bothered because I have no control to remove these things.  I am frustrated and just so mentally tired.	 I've been outside working in the yard.  the immediate improvements give me a sense of restoration and order.  I have faced the day with adherence to a routine of purpose and order.  Always my Bible study and prayer time with God gives me hope and faith.  My appreciation of all that I have is stronger as is my thankfulness.  A good lunch shared with my son was wonderful.

The muscles and tendons in both arms hurt when I lift up my arms .  Though my home inside is now neat and tidy and I am not behind on anything here, I can't make myself spray for weeds or even make a flowerbed.  I hurt. I don't feel good.  I feel guilty because I'm not pushing myself.  There is no one to help out.  I know everything will be okay.  I'm just paralyzed and without motovation.  Trees are green, birds are singing,  and the weather is warm.  I am so happy to see winter gone but don't stay outside very long before my arms and shoulders start hurting and I have to stop what I am doing. I am tense and my neck and throat hurt too.   A few days of rest will make me stronger I hope. I don't even want to get dressed or answer the phone.   I think I am just burned out .  I know this will pass in a few days and I can get back on track. "	I feel guilty because I am not pushing myself.  I am anxious and afraid I am stuck in thoughts.  I just want to stop hurting physically. I know my yard will never look the same since the storm and I will never have funds to make it like it was before.  I have accepted that.  I can't physically do the manual labor need for long at a time. And that frustrates me.  I hope I can relax and sleep better and stop feeling like a hamster stuck in a wheel going round and round.  I hope God knows how grateful I am for His restoration and blessings.  It's been hard to pray without my thoughts wandering off.  These thoughts make me restless and anxious.  I know there is nothing I can do about this pain in my arms and that makes me dread dealing with it day in and day out.  But I am not suicidal maybe mildly depressed.  Why am I not coping this week?	"I am going through the motions with my daily routine.  My house is clean and neat, everything tidy and in order.  I am cooking healthy meals and drinking lots of water.  I am making sure no bills or correspondence is being ignored.  Everything is current.  My personal hygiene is very good and I am very responsible in most things.  I purchased weed killer to spray and hope I can get started on that tomorrow.  Kitchen shelves are stocked.  Refrigerator cleaned out.  I am sticking to order and routine in all areas except outside and tasks that require using my arms for very long.  I will not allow myself to feel sorry for myself or become depressed or really irritated.  I am reassuring myself that I will feel better tomorrow.  I am thanking God often for mercy and grace. "

"This is like looking at an incomplete puzzle with pieces missing.  I want things restored and cleaned up.  My back and arms hurt so badly and trying to get the washed up debis moved  is just too much.   I am frustrated that I don't have family to help me or money to pay someone. When I see bare open patches of ground, that is how parts of me feel also."	"I go out every day and give myself a project to restore the yard.  The stuff in the water is heavy and the wheelbarrow is hard to push.   I have to come in and use the heating pad because it strains my back, arms,hips, and hands.

All the things I used to do to cope were taken away during the storm.  my room and my bathroom provided shelter from the world.  my hot baths comforted and relaxed me.  I may have been alone but they were my hugs.  I have no doors.  only recently have walls and moved back into my room.  no curtains.  my room was decorated and had my favorite things.  I felt safe in it.  I was strangled in the kitchen 6 years ago so I'm glad it was destroyed.  it was and still is a constant reminder of that trauma.  I'm so ready for it to be rebuilt so I can make new memories and enjoy cooking and cleaning and doing laundry again.  I loved it so much.  not so much after that.  The hurricane just peeled the top off and exposed my pain.   I'm glad for that although it hurt.  I want to finally heal.  I just didn't want to do it so publicly.  I'm not sure I was ready to rejoin the world.  I'm bipolar and have ptsd.  anxiety.  I've struggled for years.  I have to have a very scheduled routine life.  nothing about this is scheduled or routine.  I lost my insurance last year and haven't had medication.  so I'm dealing with this without my coping devices or medication.  I was involuntarily committed in March.  Disasters are just not good things for anyone but particularly someone with my issues and in my situation.  It's been just awful.  I'm trying to reach out but I just keep getting people who tell me they are there and they are coming to help who never show up and never call to at least tell me why they aren't coming.  I pack and prepare for them to come work and they don't show.  over and over again.  it's fine if they don't want to help but stop getting my hopes up and letting them down.  They are just pacifying a mentally ill person with no intentions of doing what they are saying.  that's dangerous and down right cruel.  they likely don't realize what they are doing because they aren't mentally ill.  believing that because it wouldn't bother them it must be ok for me.  they probably don't even think that far. complete lack of empathy.  so it makes me wonder why are they in the position of doing missionary work.  maybe it's a lesson they are learning. so, I hope those people learn to not do that any longer.  I told them I no longer wanted their help.  it was driving me crazy being let down so many times."	I'm going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist soon.

When he finally showed up several hours later, he spent a whole 10 mins assessing our bathroom only to say “ I’ll have to bring my carpenter back tomorrow and see what he says”.  Well it’s tomorrow almost 3pm and we’ve yet to hear from him. I tried really hard to be patient in the beginning because so many people were in the same if not worse situation as us. Well we’re almost 9 months out now and I am no longer patient. "	The thoughts running through my head are not very nice right now.   I see all these other people moving back into their homes and I’m really so happy for them but I’m also jealous of them. I want to go home too.	We’ve tried calling multiple plumbers to get our bathroom fixed. Once that is done we have flooring on standby and furniture on standby. We’re ready to get things done we just need the bathroom done.

If we only the knew the answer so we would know how to move forward. We need clarity so we can determine if we have enough money to buy a home or not.
